# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.23.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Stop reporting table-valued SQL functions such as `pragma_table_info(...)` as table relations; retain unresolved evidence and subsequent real tables.


## [0.23.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- `cartograph routes` exports the HTTP requests Swift code makes as an http bridge-facts document
  (`target: "http"`, `roles: ["client"]`, one `route-call` per call site), so isthmus can join app
  calls with server routes and OpenAPI operations by (method, path template). Apps call their own
  endpoint types rather than `URLSession`, and which argument is the path is not in the source, so
  wrappers are declared in an `http-wrappers` v1 file (`--wrappers`); direct `URLRequest`/`URLSession`
  requests are read when their verb and path are provable. Path composition, masking and argument
  binding follow the shared rules of the isthmus contract, and the vendored conformance vectors run
  in the test suite. Unreadable requests, pass-through helpers and stale wrapper declarations are
  counted under the contract's client-side limitation prefixes instead of disappearing, test sources
  are excluded unless `--include-tests`, and the index is optional — without one facts carry
  qualified names and `missing-route-usrs` says so.
- `cartograph routes` reads common Swift HTTP libraries without an `http-wrappers` declaration:
  URLSession/URLRequest (type URL constants, `dataTaskPublisher(for:)`, literal `relativeTo:` bases
  merged per RFC 3986), URLComponents (straight-line `scheme`/`host`/`port`/`path`/
  `percentEncodedPath` assignments), Alamofire (`AF`/`Session` requests with `method:` or the method's
  default verb, `URLRequest(url:method:)`, `request.method =`, and `URLRequestConvertible` routers), and
  Moya (`TargetType`, one fact per enum case). Apps that use these libraries directly had no facts
  unless they wrote declarations for library code. The rules follow the library sources and a recorded
  oracle: a synthetic client's 35 requests, sent through a local recording proxy on macOS 26.7 with
  Alamofire 5.12.2 and Moya 15.0.3 (`experiments/http-client-oracle`), all agree with the emitted
  templates, and a test replays the recording offline. The recording showed that
  `appendingPathComponent`, `appending(path:)` and `URLComponents.path` percent-encode `?`, `#` and
  `%` — a Moya `path` containing `?` is sent as `%3F`, not as a query — so those paths are encoded
  instead of cut at `?`. Router facts carry the enum case's USR (the target type for a struct target):
  the index records every reference to the case, so isthmus trace's reverse traversal reaches
  `provider.request(.x)` and the callers of functions that pass the case along. New gaps use the
  contract's client-side prefixes: unreadable routers and imports of unmodelled clients
  (`route-call-coverage:`), URL-rewriting Moya endpoint mappings and Alamofire adapters
  (`url-rewrite-interceptors:`), and OpenAPI generated-client runtimes (`generated-client-unscanned:`).
  `limitationScopes` are still not emitted, because none of these gaps bounds the paths it hides.
- `cartograph impact --format language-traversal` emits one multi-root traversal as an isthmus
  `language-traversal` v1 document. `change-impact` keeps one `via` per declaration, so with several
  roots isthmus could not tell which route reached which view (a logout route lost the screen `body`
  that called it), and running once per root was slow and bulky. The new document lists every root
  that reaches each declaration, computed in a single pass (a two-nearest-roots BFS plus per-tier
  root-set propagation, checked against per-root brute force and per-root `ImpactAnalyzer` runs), with
  ids equal to the `symbol.usr` of `routes`/`bridges` facts. Names carry the enclosing type
  (`ProfileView.body`) instead of only the module. Evidence tiers are per-root lower bounds: index
  edges are `direct`, override/protocol dispatch and automatic runtime connections are `candidate`,
  and a protocol dispatch is `bound` only when its single implementation is proven in a closed-world
  index. Framework- and runtime-invoked declarations such as SwiftUI `body` and `@main` are named in
  `runtime-invoked-entry-points` rather than given invented callers. `--direction dependencies` walks
  the inverse relation. `unresolvedCalls` and `dispatch` are not emitted because the Swift index does
  not record calls through closures in parameters or locals. `revision` comes from `--revision` or,
  only for a clean project tree, the git `HEAD`; `graphRevision` hashes the traversed graph, so isthmus
  can flag stale analyses instead of reporting `analysis-revision-unknown`. Roots with control
  characters are rejected up front. The `change-impact` output is unchanged.
- `cartograph impact --format language-traversal --roots-from <file|->` reads roots from a file or
  stdin, so isthmus capture can pass thousands of route-call symbols without hitting the argv limit or
  splitting the run. It accepts kartograph's `--roots-from` inputs (a JSON string array, or a
  bridge-facts document whose facts' `symbol.usr` become roots in document order) plus a line format
  (one root per line, LF or CRLF, blank lines and `#` comments skipped). File roots follow positional
  roots, exact duplicates are dropped, and input is capped at 16 MiB and 10000 combined roots. The
  list is checked before the index opens; unreadable or malformed input, empty roots and control
  characters are usage errors (64). The option is rejected outside `--format language-traversal`.
- The MCP server exposes `cartograph_affected`, the test-reachability answer `affected` gives on the
  command line. An agent that has just edited code can ask which tests reach the change from the
  session's prepared analysis instead of launching a process per question; it accepts `symbols` or
  `files` with `depth` and `limit`, like `cartograph_impact`.
- Layer rules accept optional `rationale` and `hint` fields that travel with every violation, as
  `details` lines in the `text` and `json` reports and under `rules --explain`. A bare violation
  invites the shortest edit that gets around the rule, especially from a coding agent; the team's
  reasoning now reaches whoever fixes it. Neither field is part of the baseline fingerprint.
- `affected --format xcodebuild` prints the reached tests as `-only-testing:` arguments so CI can run
  only them. A wrong identifier makes xcodebuild run zero tests and pass, so only identifiers the
  graph proves are narrowed — top-level XCTest classes without subclasses whose runtime name is their
  source name, and their parameterless `test…` methods (checked against real `xcodebuild test` runs:
  a base-class identifier skipped the subclass's inherited test, and an unknown class ran zero tests
  and passed). Swift Testing functions, nested or `@objc`-renamed classes and filtered graphs select
  their whole test module, and a truncated or unresolved answer prints no arguments and exits 2. The JSON
  document carries the proven identifier as `xcodebuildIdentifier`.
- `thresholds.max_efferent_coupling` warns when a node depends on more distinct nodes than the
  configured limit (`efferent-coupling`). Instability is a ratio, so a module depending on three
  others and one depending on thirty can both read 1.00; the absolute count catches a module that
  reaches into every layer.

### Fixed

- `routes` no longer collapses every leading slash of an `appendingPathComponent` argument:
  Foundation removes exactly one, so `//x` is sent as `//x`, and a bare path value appended to a URL
  is no longer guessed to be a single `{}` segment when it may contain slashes.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- `cartograph schema` exports the database relations Swift code references as a
  `target: "persistence"` bridge-facts document, so isthmus can join them with the
  `relation-decl` facts schemagraph produces from the SQL catalog. The scanner is
  import-gated — sqlite3 call arguments, GRDB `sql:`/`Table`/`tableExists`/`databaseTableName`,
  SQLite.swift `Table`/`prepare`/`run`, Fluent `schema`/`query(_:)` — and also reads
  ungated uppercase SQL literals; Core Data, SwiftData, Realm and other frameworks are
  counted under `limitations` because entity names are not catalog relations.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Compiler-backed complete goldens for redundant public visibility, mechanical fix plans and
  affected tests, with agent guidance on using these reports within the requested editing scope.
- Opt-in reader-cache maintenance with age and disk-budget previews, last-use markers and
  reader locks, plus a bridge source-payload/peak-memory measurement harness. Source snapshots
  remain unchanged and no memory improvement is claimed.
- A GitHub workflow that exercises composite-action SARIF uploads with actual corpus findings.
- A GitLab CI/CD component, published separately as Catalog version `1.0.0`, that runs on a
  macOS runner and publishes Code Quality findings together with the native analysis report.
  The component keeps its verified CLI `0.20.0` and archive checksum pins.

### Fixed

- Reject unexpected action exit codes and missing SARIF reports; discard stale reports before
  running a gate. README examples now pass `--since` through the supported `args` input and pin
  the downloaded binary as well as the action revision.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Include indexed Clang declarations and references from Objective-C implementation files in the
  graph, enabling external bridge retentions by actual `c:` USR. RN implementation macros now carry
  their source language and uniquely matched compiler identity; remapped JS names are not used as
  selector guesses. Missing or ambiguous identities remain unresolved.
- Export direct Swift `RCTEventEmitter` emissions with `bridges --rn-events` in a separate
  `react-native-event` v2 document for isthmus JS subscriptions. Expo, Objective-C event emitters,
  wrappers and indirect inheritance are outside the scanner's scope.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- `retain_equatable_properties` and `retain_hashable_properties` retention options (both on by
  default) keep the stored properties of `Equatable`/`Hashable` value types. The synthesized `==`
  and `hash(into:)` read those properties without leaving index evidence, so dead-code analysis
  could otherwise report them — matching Periphery's option parity, except Cartograph keeps the
  conservative default. `Hashable` implies `Equatable`, so the Equatable option alone also keeps
  Hashable types' properties; classes are excluded because synthesis does not apply to them.
- The repository ships an official composite GitHub Action (`action.yml`). It downloads a release
  binary (or uses the `binary` input), builds the index with `swift build` (or `build: none`), runs
  one gate (`check`, `dead`, `cycles` or `rules`) with SARIF output, uploads it to code scanning by
  default, and separates "findings" from "the tool could not run" through the documented exit
  codes. `fail-on-findings: false` turns it into a report-only run, and a non-macOS runner fails
  with a clear message because the tool loads `libIndexStore` from the Xcode toolchain.
- `cartograph affected` answers the CI question "which tests does this change touch": from a
  declaration, one or more files, or `--since <revision>`, it follows consumers until test
  declarations (XCTest or swift-testing) are found and reports each test's distance, the path that
  reached it, and the relationship (dependent, dispatch projection, or `changed` for a test the
  change itself touched). Selection, container expansion, dispatch projection and depth limits are
  the same machinery `impact` uses, so the two commands cannot disagree about the same change. An
  empty list says so explicitly and every response repeats that static reachability is not proof
  that existing tests cover the behavior.
- `cartograph fix` plans and applies the safe mechanical fixes for two warning classes:
  `unused-import` removes the import declaration, and `unused-parameter` drops the parameter's
  internal name while keeping its argument label. The default is a dry run that writes nothing;
  `--apply` edits the files, atomically per file. Every edit is re-located in the current source
  (the declaration at the recorded position must still match), an import line must not carry other
  code, and the rewritten file must re-parse before it is written — anything else is reported as
  skipped with a reason instead of guessed at. Baseline-suppressed findings and findings outside
  `--since` are left alone. Without `--apply`, `--strict` fails while the plan is non-empty; with
  `--apply` it fails only when an edit had to be skipped. `--format json` returns the
  `mechanical-fixes` document.
- `dead` reports public declarations whose references all come from their own module, as warnings
  under the `redundant-public` rule. The check asks two conservative questions: does any reference
  come from another module, and is the declaration mentioned in the interface of another public
  declaration? Syntax analysis classifies every reference as an interface mention or a body use —
  a type mention in a signature, superclass clause, generic constraint or default argument keeps
  the target public, while a use inside a function or accessor body does not, and a reference
  whose position cannot be determined counts as an interface mention. Overrides, protocol
  requirements and witnesses, enum cases, Objective-C/Interface-Builder/dynamic declarations, and
  declarations with no references at all are never reported (`unused-symbol` answers the unused
  question separately). With `retain_public` enabled the rule stays silent: that setting declares
  the public surface intentional, and a module reading its own public API would otherwise flood
  the report. Members are judged individually, so a public method only the module calls is
  reported even when its class is used across modules. Modules outside the index are invisible,
  so the finding is a question, not a verdict. Warnings do not count toward `--strict`.
- `dead` reports `cartograph:ignore` comments that suppress nothing, as warnings under the
  `superfluous-ignore` rule — the same judgement Periphery 3.7 added. The check is
  counterfactual: reachability is re-run with only that comment removed, and the comment is
  reported only when no new finding would appear — dead-code, test-only, assign-only-property,
  unused-import and redundant-public findings all count. Comments on genuinely dead declarations keep
  suppressing them, a comment covering a used declaration is flagged, and a file-level
  `cartograph:ignore:all` comment is judged once as a file-scope unit while per-declaration
  comments are judged independently even when every declaration in a file carries one. A
  declaration-level comment covers its whole member subtree — members it ignores are folded
  into that comment's judgement instead of being mistaken for comments of their own, while a
  member carrying its own comment is judged separately. Warnings do not count toward
  `--strict`.

### Fixed

- The persistent index-reader database no longer serves a file's occurrences from a deleted
  "ghost" unit. IndexStoreDB keeps unit entries after the unit file is removed, and
  `symbolOccurrences(inFilePath:)` could resolve to such a stale unit and return zero
  occurrences — silently dropping a whole file's edges (observed as `main.swift` losing all
  top-level references after `.build` was recreated). The unit-file set is now part of the
  database path, so a changed unit set opens a fresh reader database while an unchanged set
  keeps reusing the cache. Stale sibling databases and the unversioned legacy path are pruned
  on open, and an unreadable unit directory falls back to a dedicated `-unverified` path
  instead of reusing the legacy cache.
- `// cartograph:ignore` detection no longer treats a doc comment that merely mentions the
  directive as an ignore comment. The marker is now only recognized at the start of a comment
  line and must be followed by whitespace or end of line, so `/// Use // cartograph:ignore
  to …` documents the feature without marking the declaration ignored.

### Changed

- `serve` re-verifies the session input fingerprint at most once per second instead of
  on every tool call. Fingerprinting stats every source and index-unit file, so on
  consecutive calls it cost more than the bounded query itself — warm `query`/`status`
  latency dropped from ~9ms to ~0.1ms on this repository in measurement. Calls inside
  the one-second window are answered by the last verified generation, and a later call
  still re-reads inputs; `AnalysisSession` embedders keep the previous
  verify-every-request behavior unless they opt into `freshnessCheckInterval`. The
  window length is tunable via `serve --session-freshness-interval <seconds>`
  (`0` restores every-request verification, values outside `[0, 86400]` are rejected),
  and `cartograph_status` accepts `refresh: true` to bypass the window after an edit.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- `bridges` recognizes Expo Modules. In files that `import ExpoModulesCore`, a `Module`
  subclass's `definition()` builder or an `@ExpoModule`/`@JS` macro pair produces
  `module-export`/`component-export` facts marked `mechanism: "expo"` plus `method-handle`
  facts for the module's JS-callable functions. The
  module name follows Expo's own rules — an explicit `Name(...)`/`@ExpoModule(...)` argument,
  otherwise the class name (`String(describing:)` default). A `View` definition emits
  `component-export` on the module name, matching `requireNativeViewManager(moduleName)`.
  A `Module` subclass whose `definition()` is not visible in the file keeps a `dynamic`
  name rather than guessing. Facts keep `target: "react-native"`; the field is omitted for
  core React Native and `method-handle` facts, which old consumers read unchanged.

### Changed

- `impact` expands type/extension selections through the graph's adjacency lists
  instead of scanning the whole edge array twice. Resolving a narrow selection on a
  large graph dropped from tens of milliseconds to sub-millisecond in measurement;
  the expanded set is unchanged — member children under reached non-container
  nodes (e.g. local declarations inside a changed method) are still followed.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- `bridges` resolves three more source shapes. `+` string concatenation yields a literal when
  both sides resolve (a resolved head alone stays as the name's prefix), a property only ever
  assigned its initializer's parameter (`self.x = arg`) resolves through `Type(label:)` call
  sites when every site agrees on one channel, and a `FlutterMethodCall` handler that passes
  its `call` argument unchanged into one local method (`Task { await handleAsync(call, …) }`)
  attributes the forwarded method's arms to the registered channel. Conflicting call sites,
  rewritten arguments, overloaded names and cross-file values stay unproven.
- `impact --before` comparisons now carry a `scopeDiff` section that diffs the subgraph induced
  on the union of both change scopes. Impact traversal only walks consumers of the changed set,
  so an edge removed between two changed files was invisible — both endpoints sat in `changeScope`
  and neither appeared in `affected`. `scopeDiff.removedEdges`/`addedEdges` list edge triples that
  exist in only one graph, and `removedSymbols`/`addedSymbols` list declarations that exist in only
  one snapshot's scope. Edges whose kind the other graph's `edge_kinds` filter could not have
  contained are not reported, and a filter mismatch is noted in `limitations`.

### Changed

- Warm session queries re-check the input fingerprint without re-reading the filesystem.
  Encoded fingerprint contributions are replayed while file stamps hold, directory walks are
  reused while every observed directory stamp holds, and directory entries are built with native
  path strings instead of `appendingPathComponent` (whose NSString-backed results hashed ~40×
  slower inside sets and maps). A measured warm `cartograph_query` dropped from ~69 ms to ~12 ms.

### Fixed

- A warm session could keep serving a stale file list in two cases: a symbolic link dropped for
  visiting an already-seen target could be retargeted without invalidating the walk, and a
  directory whose enumeration failed was cached as a complete result, so a transient failure
  became permanent for the session. Both are now tracked — discarded links contribute their
  file stamps and a failed directory is never stored as a finished walk.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- The no-index-store error now reads the project root and tailors its build guidance to what
  it finds: a `Package.swift` gets the `swift build` line (plus a note when `.build` exists but
  holds no store), an `.xcodeproj`/`.xcworkspace` gets an `xcodebuild` command with the document
  and `-scheme` flags filled in, both get both, and a root with neither is told to check
  `--project` instead of being shown commands that cannot run there. The `indexStoreEmpty`
  remedies that end in build commands follow the same shape.

### Added

- `dead` now reports parameters that a reachable function's body never reads, under the
  `unused-parameter` rule at warning severity. The index does not record references to local
  symbols, so usage is proven by a SwiftSyntax body scan (scope-aware for nested functions,
  closures, and capture lists) joined to indexed parameter declarations by source position.
  Parameters of protocol requirements, dead functions, and unscanned files are never reported,
  and the warnings do not count toward `--strict` — the fix is a `_` name, not a deletion.
- `dead` now reports properties that are assigned but never read, under the `assign-only` rule
  at warning severity. The index records a read/write role on every property reference, so the
  facts come straight from `SymbolOccurrence.roles`: undirected memberwise-initializer argument
  labels count as writes, while implicit, dynamic, `addressOf`, or direction-less call accesses
  mark the property's evidence ambiguous and suppress the finding entirely. Protocol
  requirements and witnesses (whose reads record on the requirement symbol), overrides,
  runtime-managed and Objective-C/Interface Builder-exposed declarations, and stored properties
  of types with synthesized `Equatable`/`Hashable`/`Codable` conformances are excluded. The
  warnings do not count toward `--strict`.
- `dead` now reports `import` declarations a file's references never use, under the
  `unused-import` rule at warning severity. A Swift USR encodes its owning module
  (`s:<length><module>`), so each file's referenced-module set is recovered from the index;
  `import M` marker occurrences (`c:@M@M`) never count as usage. Reporting is suppressed
  whenever evidence is incomplete: files with unattributable references (clang/Objective-C
  USRs carry no module), files that reference modules they never imported (a re-export may
  supply them), conditional (`#if`) imports, re-exporting imports (`@_exported`, `public
  import`), and `cartograph:ignore`-marked imports are all excluded. The warnings do not
  count toward `--strict`.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- `setMessageHandler` on receivers the scanner cannot bind — parameters, fields, opaque
  expressions — still yields a `message-handle` fact with a dynamic channel name and its handler
  scope, instead of dropping the handler and contaminating shared registration evidence.
- Single-channel inference for `FlutterMethodCall` handlers counts only method channels again,
  so a Basic-message or event channel declared in the same file no longer defeats the guess or
  lends its name to a method handler.
- Handler scopes start at the closure `in` keyword, so capture-list initializers such as
  `{ [s = make()] _, _ in … }` classify as registration evidence instead of per-message work.
- Ambiguous evidence is reported rather than guessed: equidistant same-label symbols no longer
  pick a USR by sort order, external requirements with in-project implementations mark the
  handler scope incomplete, and top-level registrations attach the file's virtual top-level
  symbol so every fact carries an enclosing symbol.
- Inferred enclosing-symbol and conformance references keep the index-reported `targetKind`
  even when the target is outside the graph, and snapshot reference ordering is fully
  deterministic down to `targetKind`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- `cartograph bridges --messages --target flutter` exports Flutter `BasicMessageChannel` and Pigeon
  handler facts in the bridge-facts v2 exchange format. Each `message-handle` fact keeps the
  enclosing setup symbol and adds the handler closure range plus the call/reference symbols the
  compiler index actually observed at those locations, split into `registration` and `handler`
  scopes. Verified override dispatch candidates are preserved transitively so a change to a
  sub-override still reaches the bridge boundary. The scope was checked against the public
  `url_launcher_macos@3.2.2` generated Swift source; it is not a compatibility promise for every
  Pigeon form.
- `IndexedReference` records the index-reported `targetKind`, letting consumers distinguish
  graph-excluded targets such as parameters instead of treating every reference target alike.
- Handler dependency evidence is bounded by a document-wide budget and classified once per
  declaration, so large shared registration functions no longer rescan or recopy scopes per fact.

### Fixed

- Handler scopes with missing, stale, ambiguous or budget-bounded evidence stay `complete: false`
  and are counted under `incomplete-message-handler-scopes` instead of looking fully analyzed.
  Scopes duplicated through path aliases are merged rather than conflicted.
- Method-channel handler closures no longer leak helper references into a sibling
  Basic-message-channel registration scope when both kinds share one setup function.
- References rebuilt while normalizing synthesized symbols, restoring local functions and rebasing
  snapshots keep their `targetKind` instead of resetting it.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Query neighbors now include bounded reference-site evidence with actual edge endpoints, minimum-depth
  intermediates, and explicit compiler/syntax/inferred/unknown provenance.
- Query responses identify unrefined local functions by name, location, owner, reason, and suggested
  action, including ambiguous and not-found results. Evidence and diagnostics expose omitted counts.
- Analysis snapshots preserve reference provenance and detailed local-function diagnostics across rebasing;
  older snapshots retain unknown provenance instead of being upgraded to compiler evidence.
- MCP query batches share optional-evidence budgets across the response, preserving all requested results
  and accurate omission counts without repeating large evidence lists for every symbol.
- The macOS release archive includes the query evidence contract linked from its README.

### Fixed

- Recover named local-function consumers from fresh, unambiguous source/index evidence, preserving
  actual transitive caller depth and existing nonlocal reachability and graph rollups. Report the
  observed unresolved local-function count when compiler projection must remain conservative.
- Preserve a used conformance typealias when the compiler supplies an implicit base relationship at
  the same source coordinate; avoid nearest-type guesses that could create false dependencies.
- Stop treating receiver types as callers in dependency and change-impact queries.
- Distinguish concrete witness use from protocol requirement use while preserving requirement
  refinement, default implementations, class overrides, and contracts outside the selected graph.
- Refine broad index dispatch roles only with exact, unambiguous source evidence. Explicit runtime
  dispatch and unknown macro/source contexts remain conservative.
- Preserve implicit public access on protocol requirements, explicit-access extension members,
  and enum cases so library APIs are not misreported under `--retain-public`.
- Report unused helpers in external-type extensions even when the extension itself is not a
  reportable type; keep grouping members under genuinely unused local types.
- Wait for Xcode path discovery through process termination notification instead of run-loop polling,
  preserving unsuccessful-exit handling while reducing repeated session preparation overhead.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Timed observation windows for macOS and iOS Simulator debug apps. `--duration` seals v2 evidence
  without requiring an application exit call, keeps scenario success unverified, and rejects missing
  acknowledgements, inconsistent counts/identity, lost events and changed inputs.
- Compiler-confirmed notification `sink`/`onReceive` dependencies, exact SDK notification identities,
  `NSWorkspace`'s shared center, and same-scope immutable local center/object matching. Fresh local
  registrations must precede posting. Immutable token aliases, same-branch removal, exited plain-`do`
  defers and direct `AnyCancellable.cancel()` suppress later compatible posts; mutable/reassigned tokens
  and uncertain branch merges remain potential relationships. Direct compiler-confirmed
  `NotificationCenter.notifications` `for await` loops are supported without treating bare sequences as
  subscriptions or registration as callback execution.
- Manual Core Data model-to-class relationships with `.xccurrentversion` selection, migration review,
  exact `category` class-name checks, snapshot/history/`--since` impact and model-driven session/trace
  invalidation. Generated classes, `customClass` fallback and unsupported `manual` values stay unresolved;
  CI checks these rules against `momc`, generated Swift and a loaded model instance.
- Opt-in `runtime prepare-coredata` build evidence binds exact generated source/module/USRs to a verified
  source model, main-bundle compiled model, container, main executable symbols and immutable local fetch
  chain. Current-build runtime/impact/snapshot and fixed-path MCP can use it; default query/dead stays
  unchanged, dynamic-framework-only classes and mutated request/entity/context state remain unresolved.
- Conservative direct-key KVC property dependencies and all-or-nothing 16-segment key paths, with final
  receivers, explicit Objective-C exposure, exact annotated intermediate types and accessor/override
  checks. Bounded inline or immutable-local `NSPredicate(format:)` paths require literal `%K`, typed-root,
  constructor and evaluation proof. Intermediate write targets are dependencies, not setter executions.
- Compiler-confirmed immutable `Swift.Dictionary` factory/router registries with literal string keys,
  named top-level functions and immutable aliases. This does not infer closure, mutable-map, custom-map or
  external dependency-injection registries.
- Automatic runtime discovery from compiler-anchored Swift calls and object-specific Interface
  Builder connections, including name construction, selector dispatch and notification joins.
  `impact` follows validated runtime links without a contract file; unresolved boundaries remain visible.
- Compiler-confirmed NotificationCenter publisher construction boundaries, while preserving existing
  closure-observer relationships and distinguishing publisher creation from subscription execution.
- Opt-in macOS debug runtime collection with source/index and executable identity checks. Lookup,
  invocation and registration evidence are distinct; injection, timeout and dropped-event failures
  remain partial results. Collected evidence can be inspected and used in change impact.
- iOS Simulator collection for installed debug scenario apps, with explicit device/bundle selection,
  installed-binary verification and independent application exit evidence. A successful simctl command
  does not conceal crashes, missing shutdown evidence or timeouts. UIKit nil-name lookup failures are
  preserved as valid failed lookup events.
- `cartograph_runtime_discover` MCP tool and snapshot v2 runtime evidence preservation, with explicit
  limitations when loading v1 snapshots.
- Added `impact`, historical `snapshot`/`--before` comparison, combined `check`, and an MCP stdio
  server so people and coding agents can inspect change effects before editing and reuse one analysis
  session. Runtime-only declarations remain explicit review inputs rather than silently becoming
  compiler graph edges or deletion decisions.
- Added runtime dependency contracts and executable-bound observations. Plans record source/index
  freshness, loaded graph/input fingerprints and the raw SHA-256 of the executable; stale or failed
  observations remain distinguishable from unobserved coverage.

### Fixed

- macOS runtime collection now builds a universal arm64/x86_64 collector with a macOS 14 minimum.
  Cross-architecture debug applications no longer fail injection because the host compiler selected
  only its native architecture. An actual x86_64 execution probe verifies preserved results and events.

### Changed

- Split automatic source bindings, runtime syntax-name recognition and notification lifecycle tracking
  into focused scanners without changing query/retention semantics.
- `Scripts/coverage.sh --skip-test` now rejects profiles older than source, tests, fixtures, skills, scripts,
  binaries or a refreshed unit profile instead of silently reusing stale integration coverage.
- `--since` remains a finding-location lens for diagnostic commands. `impact --since` uses modeled
  source changes as seeds; it is not described as incremental analysis.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- `query` `notFound` answers now carry `candidates` — the closest names in the graph with their
  `qualifiedName`, USR and location — so a typo can be retried without another search. The single-query
  stderr message echoes the requested name and those suggestions; `dead`/`cycles`/`rules --explain`
  name the subject and offer the same suggestions instead of a bare "no match".

### Changed

- `cycles`, `rules` and `metrics` now carry the `limitations` list like `dead` does. They are CI
  gates; a gate that passes while the analysis was blind is the one thing a gate must never do. The
  metrics JSON document gained an optional `limitations` key (absent when there is nothing to report)
  and the metrics table prints `Limitation:` lines.
- Commands now reject flags they cannot honor with exit code 64 instead of silently ignoring them:
  `query` refuses `--report-format` and `--strict`, `graph` and `bridges` refuse `--report-format`
  and `--strict`, `dataflow` refuses `--strict`, `baseline` refuses `--report-format` and `--strict`
  (it writes a baseline file, it does not emit a report), and `dead --explain` refuses
  `--report-test-only`. (A previous release already made `dataflow` refuse `--report-format`.)
- `cartograph baseline` no longer writes to the path given by the `baseline_path` configuration key.
  The write destination is now `--write` or the project-root default; `baseline_path` names where
  suppression findings are read from. If `baseline_path` is set while `--write` is missing, the
  command exits 64 with guidance. A configuration key from the analyzed repository must not be able
  to point a write at an arbitrary path.

### Fixed

- The Xcode and Checkstyle reporters did not filter terminal control and format characters (the
  GitHub Actions reporter has since 0.11). A file name containing a newline could forge diagnostic
  lines in build logs, and a vertical tab in a path could invalidate the whole Checkstyle XML.
  The filter now lives in one place (`PrintableText` in `CartographCore`) and all machine reporters
  share it; the GitHub Actions reporter keeps encoding newlines as `%0A` exactly as before.
- `--since` git invocations now run with `-c core.fsmonitor=false` and `--no-optional-locks`, so a
  repository distributed with a crafted `.git` directory cannot execute a command of its choosing
  during an otherwise read-only lookup.

### Performance

- Relative-path rendering computes the base-path spelling variants once per run instead of per
  diagnostic; `retained_files` decisions are memoized per path and skipped entirely when no patterns
  are configured; layer-rule evaluation builds its assignment map once instead of twice;
  `baseline` reuses graphs of the same level instead of rebuilding them; batch queries hash the
  baseline fingerprints once instead of per answer; graph truncation for HTML/Mermaid precomputes
  node degrees instead of re-scanning edges inside the sort comparator; `dataflow` resolves
  field/closure relationships through indexes instead of linear scans.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- Objective-C bridge facts now keep their syntactic qualified name (e.g. `Plugin.handleMethodCall:result:`)
  as a name-only symbol when the index cannot uniquely identify the Clang declaration, mirroring how Swift facts
  carry one. `missing-handler-usrs` still counts Swift handlers only — Objective-C handlers
  with a name-only symbol remain under `objective-c-handlers` and outside `--external-retentions`, so
  preservation semantics are unchanged. Implements #75. Requires an isthmus build that accepts
  `sourceLanguage: "objective-c"` symbols without a USR (isthmus PR #53).

### Added

- `external-retentions` evidence can carry the full caller list (`callers`) plus `callersOmitted` for what
  the producer's cap left out. `dead --explain` lists every call site, truncating long lists with `+N more`;
  single-caller evidence renders exactly as before and older files decode unchanged. Negative
  `callersOmitted` is rejected like `omittedObjectiveCHandlers`. Implements #74.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Export bridge-facts `project` as POSIX `realpath` so `/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, and symlink aliases
  join with other producers without rewriting evidence. Unresolvable roots fail instead of emitting
  an ambiguous project identity; fact locations remain relative. Fixes #72.
- Embedded consumers providing a custom `FileSystem` must implement `realPath(at:)` to export
  bridge facts. Unsupported implementations receive an explicit implementation hint.
- Regenerate bridge-facts documents carrying old path spellings before joining them with newly
  exported documents; consumers continue to require exact `project` equality.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Added `dataflow <symbol>`, a JSON-only, budgeted interprocedural value analysis. It preserves the
  existing symbol graph semantics while exposing context summaries, argument/return, callback,
  `inout`, and field-alias effects; unsupported, stale, ambiguous, and truncated paths remain explicit.

- Bridge names can use compiler-bound interprocedural string results when every analyzed call context
  agrees. Different wrapper arguments remain dynamic in bridge-facts v1, and unverified literal
  conversions or source freshness never become confirmed names.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Optional structured `limitationScopes` in bridge-facts v1. Opaque Swift handlers supplied by
  external objects or factories are channel-scoped only when all affected channels are known.
- Bounded Objective-C Flutter bridge extraction: direct channel factories/initializers, inline
  blocks, same-file registrar delegates, immutable NSString constants and positive method-name
  comparisons. Facts carry `sourceLanguage: objective-c` without fabricated Swift identifiers.
  Actual Clang USRs are attached on unique declaration matches when available; ordinary analysis
  remains Swift-only. General Objective-C gaps remain unscoped; conditional/macro-dependent files stay deferred.
- External retention files can report `omittedObjectiveCHandlers` so graph-external matches remain
  visible in cartograph limitations. The consumer must support these extensions before the new
  producer is deployed; missing symbols on unmarked Swift handlers still fail closed.

### Fixed

- Bridge limitations count unresolved registration/handler facts without claiming that a literal
  method name is dynamic when only its channel is unresolved. Cross-function runtime probes now
  distinguish symbol reachability from unsupported argument/return value propagation.

- Resolve immutable Swift bridge-name aliases and parentheses in their declaration scope, with a
  bounded depth. Parameters, captures, patterns, computed properties and mutable strings no longer
  borrow a misleading outer constant. Accessors use their own scopes, and channel assignments
  merge at the existing lexical/member binding. Operators and cross-file values remain dynamic.

- The preserved flutter_local_notifications notes classify 19 of the reported 20 issues. The
  remaining one is now explicitly unclassified instead of presenting an inconsistent complete split.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Separated `**` segments (`**/a/**/a/.../missing`) no longer revisit the same matching states.
  A two-row dynamic program also removes recursive array copying. A 25-segment failing match
  with ten `**/a` groups measured 2.09 s before and 0.000041 s after in an optimized local harness.
- Batch name lookup now builds a name index once instead of sorting every graph node for each
  request. On a 20,000-node synthetic graph, 1,000 name lookups measured 8.48 s before;
  the new index builds in 14 ms and answers the batch in 0.42 ms (optimized local harness,
  excluding index-store I/O and JSON rendering). Name/USR precedence, ambiguity, and
  qualified-member matching are unchanged. Query edge names retain their prior lexical order,
  independently of the graph model's edge-kind ordering.
- Source permission and I/O failures keep affected declarations with an explicit `sourceUnavailable`
  reason and appear in `query`/`dead` limitations. Missing files are reported separately instead of
  being confused with unreadable files.
- Index freshness uses each source file's latest index unit, so building a different target cannot
  hide an edited file. Files without a known unit are counted separately. Older snapshot documents
  without per-file timestamps remain readable.
- Release tag input is passed through an environment variable and validated before writing workflow
  state. The Homebrew token is available only in the tap update step.

- Consecutive `**` segments in a glob pattern no longer multiply matching time. Each `**`
  branched the search, so `**/**/**` on a deep tree grew ~30x per pair of stars (8 stars on a
  25-segment path measured 17 s); they collapse to one `**`, which matches identically, and the
  same case now takes under a millisecond. The written pattern is untouched, only the segments
  used for matching.

### Changed

- Graph name lookup and neighborhood traversal live in `CartographAnalysis`; project limitation
  collection is separate from `CartographService`. The existing Kit `NodeLookup` name remains an alias.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- `query --since <revision>` is now rejected as a usage error (exit 64) instead of being quietly
  ignored. `query` answers one declaration rather than a list of findings, so the revision lens has
  nothing to attach to; accepting it turned a comparison that cannot differ into evidence. The
  rejection happens during argument validation, before the index is opened, like the existing
  `baseline` + `--since` guard.
- The same silent `--since` is now rejected everywhere else it had nowhere to attach:
  `graph` (which renders the whole project — a scoped cut would mislead before it could narrow),
  `bridges` (a partial export would read as missing handlers in the downstream join), and
  `dead`/`cycles`/`rules --explain` (one-subject answers like `query`). Bare `dead`/`cycles`/`rules
  --since` over the finding list still works; only the `--explain` combination is refused.
- `--level` combinations that change nothing are rejected the same way. `dead --level module`
  printed byte-identical output to bare `dead` (both always run at symbol level), and `query`,
  `bridges` and `baseline` likewise never read the flag. Only `graph`, `cycles`, `metrics` and
  `rules` honor it. A `level:` key in the configuration file is untouched — this refuses only the
  explicit command-line flag, so existing configurations keep working.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- `query --batch <requests.json>` answers many declarations from one index read. The requests file
  is a JSON array of 1 to 1000 names or USRs, at most 1 MiB, and the results come back in request
  order with duplicates kept so the caller can pair the two arrays by index. Sweeping a `dead`
  report one name at a time cost a process and an index read per name; on a 7,466-symbol app,
  asking about all 43 findings took 19.6 s that way and 0.47 s in one batch, and all 43 answers
  were identical to the one-at-a-time answers. An `ambiguous` name is a normal result. If any name
  is not found the exit code is 64, but every other result is still returned. A malformed requests
  file is rejected before the index is opened and exits 64 rather than 2, because it is an argument
  problem and not a failure to analyze; the names that were not found are listed on stderr so a
  failed sweep does not send you back to diff the JSON. A batch answers every request from one
  snapshot, so a sweep cannot straddle a rebuild the way one process per name can. The output is
  the `symbol-query-batch` v1 format that dartograph already writes, so an agent learns one
  response shape rather than one per language.
- An ambiguous name now returns candidates you can choose between. Each candidate carries its
  `kind`, `module`, declaration site and `container` alongside the USR, and `dead --explain` prints
  the same. `qualifiedName` is `Module.name` and leaves out the owning type, so asking a real app
  about `body` returned 127 candidates of which 122 printed as the identical string
  `HealthMap.body`; the same query now yields 127 distinct rows. The `container` is what makes the
  answer self-sufficient: typing `qualifiedName` back re-ambiguates at 122, so every candidate now
  also carries the `Container.member` spelling that resolves to exactly it. Candidates come in file
  and line order rather than USR order, because the column a reader scans is the location.
  `dead --explain` shows the first 20 and says how many it left out and where the full list is;
  printing all 127 filled 255 lines of terminal, which is not a list you can choose from either.
- `query` and `dead --explain` accept `Container.member`, so you can narrow an ambiguous name with
  a name you just read in the answer instead of copying a USR. Nesting works to any depth
  (`Outer.Inner.leaf`), the outermost part may be the module (`App.Outer.leaf`), and an
  intermediate container may be left out (`Outer.leaf`) because knowing only the outer type is the
  normal case; over-matching comes back as `ambiguous` rather than a guess. The container may be
  the type an extension extends, so a member declared in an extension answers to its type's name.
  This runs only when the plain lookup found nothing, so a declaration literally named
  `Detail.body` still wins.

### Fixed

- The CLI contract script no longer needs an index store to check `query --batch`. It ran the batch
  without `--project`, so it analyzed the working directory; in the release workflow, which re-runs
  the script against the unpacked binary in a checkout that was never built, that exits 2 and the
  check measured the presence of an index rather than the behaviour of the batch. It now uses the
  empty-index fixture with the escape hatch. This broke the first 0.8.0 release build, which is
  where a contract script is supposed to catch things.
- Three retention reasons made `dead --explain` ungrammatical. The sentence is "X is retained
  because it is <reason>", and three reasons began with a verb, producing "it is satisfies a
  protocol declared outside the analyzed code". They are now "required by a protocol declared
  outside the analyzed code", "an override of a declaration outside the analyzed code" and
  "matched by a retain rule in the configuration". A test now reads every reason through the
  sentence it will appear in.

### Changed

- References are no longer sorted on the way out of the index store. Every reference in the project
  was put through an `O(n log n)` sort whose comparator built a three-`String` tuple per comparison,
  and there are roughly ten references per symbol. The order was never read: `CodeGraph.init` folds
  edges by signature and sorts them again, the retention scan builds a `Set`, and the extension-target
  map is keyed by a USR that a Swift extension can only have once. On a 7,466-symbol app each command
  loses about 0.13 s of wall clock — `dead` 0.64 s to 0.48 s, `graph --level symbol` 0.66 s to 0.53 s,
  `cycles` 0.49 s to 0.36 s. Output is byte-identical across seven commands on four projects; the only
  difference found anywhere was the `generatedAt` field of `bridges`, which differs between two runs of
  the same binary. That the order does not reach the output was true by accident and is now a test.

  One place did depend on the order and is now closed. The extension-target map let the last
  `.extends` reference for a USR win, which was harmless while the input was sorted. A Swift
  extension USR can only name one extended type, and instrumenting the map found no duplicate on
  four apps, the corpus, and all four graph levels; but "last wins" with an unsorted input means
  the index decides, so the map now takes the smaller USR and cannot vary with order.

- The path filter is evaluated once per file rather than once per symbol. It is a property of the
  file, and a file carries dozens of symbols, so the same path was matched against every glob
  thousands of times; a sampled profile put that one call at about a third of every command. On a
  7,466-symbol app `graph --level symbol` drops from 0.71-0.75 s to 0.64-0.65 s and `dead` from
  0.64-0.68 s to 0.58-0.63 s, with byte-identical output. The wall-clock share is smaller than the
  profile share because reading the index store dominates.

### Documented

- Both READMEs now say that a property which is only ever assigned counts as used. The graph has
  one `reference` edge kind and does not carry the index's read/write distinction, so an assignment
  looks exactly like a read. Reproduced in a four-line package: `dead` reports nothing and `query`
  answers `reachable`. Telling the two apart needs read and write edge kinds, which is tracked, not
  started.

### Removed

- The known limitation "a retained member inside an unreachable type still answers retained" is
  gone from both READMEs and from the agent skill, where it was rule 6. The change below fixed it;
  the documents still described the old behaviour. Verified on a real app: `query` on the `body` of
  an unreachable `View` now reports `state: unreachable`, and `dead --explain` says "not reachable
  from any retained root" instead of naming the framework.

### Fixed

- A member is no longer reported as `retained` inside a type the same run calls `unreachable`.
  A `body` that satisfies `View`, or an `encode(to:)` that satisfies `Codable`, is kept because the
  framework calls it — and the framework calls it only if something constructs the type. Asking
  about the type said "never used" while asking about its member said "the framework calls this, do
  not delete it", in one answer. Witness retentions now wait for their owning type to become
  reachable, reusing the mechanism the reverse-override traversal already had, and a retention that
  never activates is dropped so the reason set stays a subset of what is reachable. A witness with
  no owning type — an extension of a type outside the analyzed code — stays unconditional, because
  there is nothing for it to wait for.

  On four real projects the reported findings and the test-only list are unchanged; only the
  reachable count falls, which is the point.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- Types are reported again. Two retention rules were keeping every type alive: a member that
  overrides or satisfies a declaration outside the analyzed code kept its owning type, and so did a
  compiler-synthesized member such as a memberwise initializer. Between them, a `View` nobody draws
  and a `struct NeverUsed: Equatable {}` were immortal, and the tool had never reported a single
  unused type on a real app. Both rules now keep the member and stop there. The same guard covers a
  conformance written as `extension X: View`, so the two spellings of one piece of code cannot give
  opposite answers.

  Measured on four projects, with every new finding checked by hand — each has exactly one
  occurrence, its own declaration:

  | project | findings | new | no longer reported |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | cartograph | 0 → 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | HealthMap (7,466 nodes) | 43 → 43 | 7 types | 7 members of those types |
  | AnbuRadar | 6 → 6 | 0 | 0 |
  | Gakjaba | 1 → 2 | 1 type | 0 |

  The HealthMap row is the point: the count did not move, but seven shell members left and the seven
  types that hold them arrived. Deleting the members, as the old output invited, left an empty type
  that could never be reported again.

  A member can still answer `retained` while the type that holds it is `unreachable` — a `body` is
  kept because the framework calls it, which is true only if something constructs the type. `dead`
  reports the type in that case, so a sweep is right; a single `query` on the member is not. Both
  READMEs and the agent skill now say so.

### Fixed

- A type used only as an enum case's associated value, as the right-hand side of a `typealias`, or
  as the witness of an `associatedtype` now has an edge to it in the graph. The index records those
  references, but with no relation to the declaration that holds them, and the adapter only built an
  edge when a relation was present — so those types had no incoming edge at all and were kept alive
  only by the retention rule for compiler-synthesized members. That is an accident, not an answer,
  and it is the reason narrowing the retention rules would have reported types whose deletion does
  not compile. The reference is attributed to the closest preceding declaration in the same file,
  which is all the index gives: it has locations, not ranges.

  The attribution is deliberately narrow. It applies only where the indexer is known to omit the
  relation — an enum case, a `typealias`, an `associatedtype` — and never to an implicit occurrence.
  A wider rule attaches macro-expanded code to whatever declaration precedes the attribute line,
  because `@Observable` records its expansion at the attribute rather than at the type: on one real
  project that invented two circular dependencies between types that do not reference each other.
  Measured on four projects, this version adds only the intended edges (`+4`, `+18`, `+6`, `0`) and
  changes no finding and no cycle.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- A package that exports library products while `retain_public` is off now says so in
  `limitations`. Its callers live outside the repository, so the entire public surface comes back
  unreachable, and a consumer that turns that list into deletions breaks every dependent. Reproduced
  on a package with one library product: two public types reported with the default, none with
  `--retain-public`. The check reads the manifest and stays silent when any executable product is
  declared, because then the entry point is inside the repository and reachability means what it
  says.

- The limitations list reaches every report format a CI job reads, not only JSON. A gate that passes
  while the analysis was blind to twelve Objective-C files is the one thing a gate must never do,
  and until now the only way to see that was to ask for JSON. `text` counts them in the summary line
  and prints a `limitations:` block after it, `xcode` emits a location-less `note:`,
  `github-actions` emits a `::notice` with no file so it lands on the run summary, and `sarif` puts
  them in `runs[].invocations[].toolExecutionNotifications` rather than in `results`, so code
  scanning does not count them as alerts. Exit codes and finding counts are unchanged. `checkstyle`
  is left alone on purpose: its schema has no slot that is not a file's `<error>`, and adding one
  would raise the finding count its consumers display.

### Changed

- Two limitations that fired on every run are gone from the list. `single-configuration` counted
  nothing: it was a statement about index stores in general rather than about this project, which
  is the definition of copying the README into the answer. `configured-path-filter` fired even on a
  project with no `.cartograph.yml`, because `exclude` defaults to `defaultExcludes`; it now fires
  only when include is set or exclude narrows the analysis past those defaults. Measured on four
  real projects, both fired on all four. A warning that fires every time is not read, and this list
  is where the tool says what it cannot see. The `#if` sentence now lives in the Known limitations
  of both READMEs and in the agent skill, where it belongs. `dead --report-format json` omits the
  `limitations` key entirely when there is nothing to report, rather than emitting an empty array.

- `IndexStoreLocator.derivedDataCandidates` takes `projectNames: [String]` instead of a single
  `projectName`. Ownership has to be decided over the union of every name at once: with one call per
  name, a name whose owner is proven does not stop another name's group from falling back to
  unverified directories. `CartographError.indexStoreNotFound` also carries a `derivedData:`
  associated value, defaulted to nil so existing construction still compiles; code that pattern-matches
  that case has to be updated.

### Fixed

- The SwiftPM dependency line both READMEs advertise does not resolve. `from: "0.5.5"` fails with
  `package 'cartograph' is required using a stable-version but 'cartograph' depends on an
  unstable-version package 'indexstore-db'`, because indexstore-db publishes no semantic-version
  tags and is pinned to a release branch. `revision: "0.5.5"` resolves and builds, so that is what
  the instructions say now, with the reason next to it. Reproduced both forms in a throwaway package.

- Auto-detection finds the index store of an Xcode project that does not live in a directory of its
  own name. The candidate names came only from the last component of `--project`, so
  `ios/HealthMap.xcodeproj` was looked up as `ios-<hash>` and never found, and the "Searched:" list
  held no DerivedData path at all, so there was no way to tell it had even been considered. Every
  Flutter and React Native app has that shape. Names now come from each `.xcodeproj` and
  `.xcworkspace` directly inside the project root, plus the folder's own name, which a Swift package
  opened in Xcode still needs. Only the root is scanned: recursing would make `Pods/Pods.xcodeproj`
  a name and open another project's store. Verified on three real apps on the author's machine, all
  of the `ios/<Name>.xcodeproj` shape, which now analyse with no flags at all.
- A DerivedData directory whose `info.plist` names a different project is never used, and when two
  or more match by name while none of them names this project, the run fails and lists them instead
  of silently taking the most recent. Picking one there analyses another project's index with
  nothing in the output to say so.
- Ownership is decided by containment in either direction. A `WorkspacePath` pointing at the parent
  of `--project` means the analysis was scoped to a source directory inside the workspace, which is
  a common way to run it, and the previous one-directional test called that a foreign checkout.
- The flat layout that `xcodebuild -derivedDataPath <dir>` writes is a candidate too, so the
  `--derived-data` flag works for the CI recipe the README documents.
- The failure message says what it looked for in DerivedData: the root, the names tried, and which
  of the four situations it hit — no such root, no name matched, names matched but nothing was built
  there, or directories matched but none of them names this project.
- `index-staleness` is reported for a store found under DerivedData. The freshness check resolved the
  store a second time without the DerivedData path, so it silently found nothing there and said
  nothing. That silence covered exactly the projects this change now opens, and Xcode-built projects
  are where an index goes stale most often.
- An analysis whose index store knows none of the project's declarations now fails with exit code 2
  instead of reporting "no findings" and exiting 0. A green `--strict` gate over zero analysed
  declarations reads as "this code is clean", which is the one thing a gate must never say by
  accident. The error names the project, the store and how it was chosen, the `libIndexStore` it
  used, how many Swift files are under the project and how many survived include/exclude, and the
  unit count — the three counts are what separate a wrong `--project` from a filter that removed
  everything from a store built for another checkout. `--allow-empty-index` opts out for a run that
  is meant to analyse nothing, and then `limitations` carries `empty-index` so the answer still says
  it is a statement about nothing. `bridges` does not go through this guard: its scan is syntactic
  and `Scripts/scan-public-plugins.sh` runs it against an index that contributes nothing by design.
- Exclude globs no longer match the project root's *ancestor* directories. Matching them against the
  absolute path meant that a project living under a directory named `DerivedData`, `Pods`,
  `Generated`, `.build` or `Carthage` had every one of its files removed by the default excludes, so
  the graph was empty and `--strict` passed. The same happened to any user pattern whose name
  appeared above the project root. Excludes are now matched against the project-relative path;
  patterns written as absolute paths still apply to absolute paths, and includes are unchanged
  because narrowing those is the failure this filter exists to prevent. Reproduced with one package
  built in two directories that differed only in their parent's name: 7 nodes and 3 findings under
  one, 0 nodes and a clean exit under the other.
- `retained_files` globs no longer match the project root's ancestor directories either. The rule
  lived in a second place and only the exclude side had been fixed, which left the same false green
  by the opposite route: one pattern whose name appears above the project root retained every
  declaration, so `dead` reported nothing. Reproduced with `retained_files: ["**/repro/**"]` on a
  project under a directory of that name, turning 3 findings into 0 with exit 0. Both directions now
  go through one method on `PathFilter`, because a rule kept in two places gets fixed in one.
- A run that used `--allow-empty-index` says so in the text summary, not only in the JSON
  `limitations`: `dead: no findings (analysed nothing — --allow-empty-index) — …`. A CI log shows
  the summary line and nothing else, so an escape hatch that is invisible there disarms the guard
  completely.
- The error no longer advertises `--allow-empty-index` when it has already named the cause. On the
  wrong-path and everything-filtered branches the last and most prominent line used to be the flag
  that silences the check, which is the opposite of the next action. It now appears only when the
  tool genuinely cannot tell a misconfiguration from a deliberately empty run.
- A project with Objective-C sources and no Swift is told that, instead of being told its
  `--project` is wrong. A Flutter or React Native `ios/` directory is usually that shape, and the
  path is right.
- A project root given as a symbolic link is walked to the end. The URL-based directory enumeration
  fails with `ENOTDIR` on a link to a directory while `directoryExists` follows it, so the traversal
  found a directory it could not read and silently produced an empty tree. Pointing at this
  repository through a link reported 0 nodes where the real path reported 1,644.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- `bridges` reads through a parenthesized switch subject, `switch (call.method)`. sensors_plus writes
  it that way and five of its handlers were invisible; the first real Dart-to-Swift join on
  plus_plugins is what showed it.
- The `bridges` document now carries `objective-c-sources: N` when the project has `.m` or `.mm`
  files. A Flutter handler written in Objective-C is not in the Swift facts, and without the
  limitation isthmus reports the Dart invocation as unhandled, which it is not — package_info_plus
  and share_plus are that case.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- `docs/scans/2026-09-flutter-plugins.md` measures what `bridges` sees on fourteen public Flutter
  and React Native repositories, with `Scripts/scan-public-plugins.sh` to reproduce it. The
  headline: first-party Flutter plugins have moved to Pigeon (703 `BasicMessageChannel`
  constructors in `flutter/packages`, one `FlutterMethodChannel`), community plugins still use string
  channels in the `FlutterPlugin.handle(_:result:)` shape, and about half of the popular plugins
  implement iOS in Objective-C where this tool sees nothing.
- The repository is a Claude Code plugin: `/plugin marketplace add ictechgy/cartograph` then
  `/plugin install cartograph@cartograph` installs the same skill `cartograph skill` writes. The
  plugin points at `Skills/`, so there is no third copy of the file beyond the two the drift test
  already compares.
- `docs/demo/agent-deletes-native-handler/` is a draft reproduction of the failure this tool
  exists to prevent, awaiting a Flutter toolchain to be run end to end.

### Fixed

- `bridges` attributes a `FlutterPlugin.handle(_:result:)` to the channel named by
  `registrar.addMethodCallDelegate(instance, channel:)` instead of guessing from "the only channel in
  the file". On the scanned repositories this turned 52 of 110 handlers from inferred into
  attributed. Handlers passed as method references (`setMethodCallHandler(handleCall)`) are
  attributed to their channel, and `setMethodCallHandler(nil)` is no longer reported as a
  registration. All three shapes came from audioplayers and plus_plugins, not from the corpus.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-09-05

### Changed

- `bridges` now emits project-relative locations and UTC millisecond timestamps, and
  `--target flutter|react-native` can split a mixed project into a v1 document that isthmus can
  consume without guessing.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-09-04

A follow-up review of 0.5.1 at maximum effort found that the scoping introduced there stopped at
function declarations. This release finishes it.

### Fixed

- Channel variables are looked up the same way constants are: a `let channel = …` in one type
  never stands in for a same-named variable in another, a closure sees the locals of the function
  that encloses it but its own locals do not leak outward, and a nested function's locals are keyed
  the same way in both passes. Each of these was a path to a literal the scanner had not actually
  seen. `dead --explain` says when a retention matched by qualified name rather than by USR.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-04

A review round over 0.5.0 with four independent reviewers (GLM, Codex, Antigravity, Grok). Every
change here closes a path where `bridges` could emit a literal it had not actually seen, or where
`--external-retentions` could keep or drop a declaration without saying so.

### Fixed

- `bridges` no longer resolves an implicit member (`FlutterMethodChannel(name: .channelName)`) to a
  same-named constant in the file. The receiver of that expression is `String`, not any type the
  file declares, so the literal it produced could be wrong and would have joined in isthmus as if
  certain. It is now `dynamic`. Constants are looked up by their declaring type — `A.name` and
  `B.name` no longer share one slot — and are resolved after the whole file has been read, so a
  `static let` declared below the `init` that uses it is followed as documented.
- A `case "…"` is attributed to a handler only when the switch subject really is a method name:
  `call.method`, or a local that was assigned from it (`let m = call.method`). A bare `.method`
  enum case no longer counts. Cases wrapped in `#if` are found. `FlutterMethodCall?` and
  `Flutter.FlutterMethodCall` parameters put a function in handler context like the plain type.
- `@objc(Name) @objcMembers` classes export only what Objective-C can see: `private`, `fileprivate`
  and `@nonobjc` members are skipped, nested types do not inherit the exposure, and extensions of
  the class do.
- The Objective-C macro scanner ignores macros in trailing `//` comments, string literals and
  `#if 0` regions, keeps a block whose `@end` is missing when the next `@implementation` starts,
  and treats an empty `RCT_EXPORT_METHOD()` as a dynamic name rather than an empty one.
- `bridges` attaches a USR by the exact selector only; when that fails it falls back to the base
  name only if exactly one declaration carries it. Index paths and walked paths are compared after
  resolving symlinks, so `/private/tmp` and `/tmp` no longer split a file's symbols from its facts.
  The symbol table is built once per run instead of once per file.
- `target` is written as `null` when there are no facts, as the exchange format requires, instead
  of being omitted.
- `--external-retentions`: a retention that carries a USR no longer shadows a name-only retention
  for the same qualified name. When a name-only retention matches several declarations they are
  all kept, as the retention rules require, and the count is reported as
  `external-retentions-ambiguous`. The file is read before the index store, so a broken file fails
  even where there is no index. `generatedAt` with fractional seconds (which is what isthmus
  writes) is parsed, so the staleness check fires. Evidence strings are stripped of control
  characters before they reach the terminal.
- New limitation counters: `unscanned-message-channels` (Pigeon's `BasicMessageChannel`),
  `objective-c-handlers` (RN handlers in `.m` files, which carry no USR and so cannot be retained
  through a retentions file), and `objc-named-classes` now includes the method handles it implies.
  `mixed-targets` says when `target` was chosen on a tie.
- A local `let name = "…"` is visible only inside the function that declares it. Hoisting it to
  the file would have turned every bare `name` in the file into that literal, including references
  to a global declared elsewhere. `let m = call.method` aliases are likewise scoped to their
  function or handler closure, and a function nested inside a method body is neither an enclosing
  declaration nor an exported React Native method. Members of a `private extension` are not
  exported; an explicit `@objc private func` is; `static` and `class` methods are not.
- The agent skill no longer implies that a retentions file being present settles an `unreachable`
  handler, and names `retainedByMember` alongside `retained` as the states that carry
  `reason: externalBridge`. Reinstall it with `cartograph skill --force`; the copy written by 0.4.0
  or 0.5.0 keeps the old wording until then.
- Because the retentions file is now read before the index store, a broken file fails every
  analysis command, not only `dead`, which is the same treatment a broken baseline gets.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- `cartograph bridges` exports what Swift declares at a language boundary, in the `bridge-facts`
  exchange format that isthmus joins with the Dart or JavaScript side. A Flutter method-call
  handler or a React Native module is called from another language, which the compiler index never
  sees, so until now it was reported unreachable with no way to say otherwise. The only link
  between the two sides is a string — `FlutterMethodChannel(name:)`, `case "takePhoto":`,
  `@objc(CalendarManager)`, `RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(addEvent:)` — and this command reads those literals
  with SwiftSyntax (and a text scan for the Objective-C macros), then attaches the USR the index
  holds for the enclosing declaration so the answer can come back as a retention.

  It states facts, not verdicts. A non-literal name is kept with its source expression and marked
  `dynamic` rather than dropped; one level of constant is followed, but only through `Self`, `self`
  or a type declared in the same file, so a same-named member on some other receiver never turns
  into a literal it is not. A `case "…"` outside a handler closure counts only inside a function
  that takes a `FlutterMethodCall`, and is attributed to the file's single channel (counted as
  inferred) or left `null`. `limitations` counts what could not be resolved. The Objective-C
  macro files are the first `.m` sources this tool reads at all; block comments are blanked first
  so a module someone commented out does not come back as a handler.

- `--external-retentions <path>` (or `external_retentions_path`) reads the retentions isthmus hands
  back and keeps each named declaration as a retained root with reason `externalBridge`. `dead
  --explain` quotes the evidence — which platform, file and line invoked which method on which
  channel — instead of pointing at the file. `query` lists the file's provenance and how many of its
  retentions name nothing in the index, so a stale file shows up as a limitation before it shows up
  as a wrong deletion, and a file generated before the index store was written is flagged as
  stale. A retention that carries a USR matches only that USR; the name is used only when isthmus
  had no USR to give, so a same-named declaration in another module cannot be kept by mistake. A
  configured path that does not exist is a tool failure, not a silent no-op: someone who supplied
  the file expects it to be applied.

- `dead --report-format json` now carries the same `limitations` list as `query`. An agent that
  starts from the unused list and walks it towards deletions had no way to learn that the project
  has Objective-C sources, that the index predates its edits, or that an external retentions file
  was (or was not) in effect. As with `query`, the list is never empty on `dead` — the
  single-configuration note always applies — and the key is absent from `cycles` and `rules`,
  which have no retention rules to be limited by.

### Fixed

- `dead --report-test-only` no longer reports a type as "reached only from tests" when the only
  thing keeping it alive is its compiler-synthesized memberwise initializer. No test had touched
  it; the synthesized root was excluded from the production traversal but the type it belonged to
  was not excluded from the candidates. The false-positive corpus caught this while a public struct
  stub was being added for the bridge fixture.

- The agent skill named retention reasons that do not exist (`objcExposed`, `codingKeys`,
  `caseIterable`). It now lists the values the tool actually emits.

### Changed

- The false-positive corpus gains an Objective-C target. Every iOS project available for
  dogfooding was pure Swift, so the `objective-c-sources` limitation had never been observed on a
  real `.m` file; `verify-fixtures.sh` now checks it is counted, and pins the `bridges` output
  against a real index so the syntax-to-USR attachment is verified by the compiler rather than by a
  hand-built snapshot.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- `cartograph skill` installs `.claude/skills/cartograph/SKILL.md`, teaching a coding agent to ask
  this tool about a symbol instead of grepping for it. The same file is committed under `Skills/`
  and a test fails if the two drift, so the version a human reviews is the version an agent
  receives.

  Most of the skill is about what an answer does not prove. An agent turns a verdict into an edit
  without pausing, so a file that only taught the commands would make wrong deletions faster: it
  says that `unreachable` is a fact about the graph rather than permission to delete, that
  `limitations` must be read in the same breath, that `suppressedByBaseline` means the team already
  decided, and that loading the whole graph answers nothing `query` could not.

  It also states the one thing most likely to cause real damage: `retain_public` is off by default,
  so in a library or framework the entire public surface is reported unreachable, and an agent that
  acted on that would break every consumer outside the repository.

  Passing the rules is not treated as permission. A checklist an agent can complete becomes a
  licence to proceed, which would reproduce the exact failure the skill exists to prevent, so the
  file says what to do afterwards — delete only what was asked, report what was checked, and name
  the limitations that applied rather than deleting and hoping.

- `cartograph query <symbol>` answers three questions about one declaration as JSON: who uses it,
  what it uses, and whether it is reachable from a retained root. Every other command sweeps the
  project and reports findings; this one answers a question the caller already has, and reverse
  reachability ("who uses this?") was not answerable at all before.

  The output is deliberately not a verdict. `state` is a fact about the graph and the retention
  reason ships as a value rather than as prose, so the caller decides what it means. Every response
  carries `limitations` — counted from the Objective-C sources and Interface Builder documents
  actually present in the project, not copied from the README — so a consumer that never reads the
  documentation still learns why an `unreachable` answer might be wrong. A baseline the team already
  accepted is marked `suppressedByBaseline` instead of being re-litigated, and a name matching
  several declarations returns the candidates with their USRs instead of a guess.

  `--depth` and `--limit` bound the answer in each direction, with `truncated` flags so a capped
  answer is never mistaken for a complete one. Reachability is always computed on the symbol-level
  graph regardless of `--level`, which is why the response states its own level.

  Each neighbour carries every relation that reaches it rather than one of them — a subclass that
  both calls and overrides comes back as `["call", "overrides"]`, and reporting one of the two would
  let a consumer delete on half the picture. Containment is reported separately as `members` and
  `declaredIn`, because a type does not *use* its own methods, but omitting them entirely made
  `dependsOn` come back empty for every class on a symbol-level graph, which reads as "depends on
  nothing".

  `limitations` is counted from the project within the same include/exclude scope the graph uses,
  and ships on `notFound` too: asking about a name declared in Objective-C and being told only "no
  such thing" hides the difference between absent and invisible. Besides Objective-C sources and
  Interface Builder documents it reports sources edited since the index store was written — the most
  dangerous silence for a consumer deciding to delete — and a configured path or edge-kind filter
  that could be the reason `usedBy` is empty.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- `Fixtures/FalsePositiveCorpus` collects the patterns that produced false positives in real code,
  as a package that actually compiles, and `Scripts/verify-fixtures.sh` compares the whole finding
  list in both directions — a new false positive and a lost detection fail equally. Unit tests run
  on hand-built snapshots, so they cannot check what the compiler writes into the index store, and
  every false positive found in this repository lived exactly there. CI runs it.

- `dead --report-test-only` reports production declarations reached only from tests or previews.
  They are not dead, so they are reported as `info` and never fail a build, but a team wants to know
  that tests are the sole caller. Declarations inside test targets are excluded — a module that
  contains test declarations is a test target — previews do not count, since a `#Preview` lives in
  the production module beside the view it previews. On a real project this cut the list from 408
  to 90.
- `cycles --explain <node>` lists the cycles one node takes part in, each with the edge to cut.
  `rules --explain <node>` shows which layer a node landed in, which pattern put it there, and
  which rules start from that layer. Reporting a tangle is accurate; naming the cut is actionable.
  Participation is judged by strongly connected component, not by the representative path, so a node
  in the same tangle is never told it is outside the cycle. `cycles --explain` counts its answer as
  a finding (being in a cycle is a bad state that `--strict` should catch); `rules --explain` does
  not, because a layer assignment is not a bad state. Neither is narrowed by `--since`: you asked
  about one node, so the answer is computed against the whole graph.
- `--since <git-revision>` reports only findings located in files changed since that revision —
  committed changes, uncommitted changes to tracked files, and new files. The graph is still built
  from the whole project, because reachability on a partial graph is simply wrong; only the report
  narrows. It answers "what did this change touch", not "what did this change cause", so `baseline`
  refuses to combine with it: a partial record would later make every out-of-scope finding look new.
- Syntax analysis results are cached per file, keyed by file content. A run that changes no source
  skips SwiftSyntax parsing entirely. The cache lives in the temporary directory, never in the
  repository, and is keyed by content rather than modification time so a checkout or a copy cannot
  serve a stale result. `CartographEnvironment.usesSyntaxCache` turns it off.

### Fixed

- A property used only through its projected value (`Child(text: $name)`) is no longer reported as
  unused. The index records the reference against `$name`, and nothing linked it back to `name`,
  so SwiftUI state that is plainly in use was reported as dead. Only the projected value is folded
  into the wrapped property — backing storage (`_name`) is referenced by the synthesized memberwise
  initializer, and folding that would hide genuinely unused properties.
- `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor`, `@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor`, `@WKApplicationDelegateAdaptor`
  and `@WKExtensionDelegateAdaptor` properties are retained. SwiftUI owns the delegate; no code
  reads the property, but removing it breaks the app.
- Cases of a `CaseIterable` enum are retained. A case consumed only through `allCases` has no
  reference in the index, because the synthesized `allCases` body has no source range — the same
  mechanism as raw-representable enums.

### Performance

- Source discovery no longer calls `stat` twice per directory entry. It now reads each entry's type
  from the single enumeration that already knows it. On a 13,000-symbol project whose repository
  contains 210,000 entries, `dead` went from 33s to 2.2s — a profile showed the whole runtime was
  file-tree traversal, not analysis.

### Changed

- Layer-violation baseline fingerprints now include the rule name and the edge kind. Two rules
  denying the same edge used to share one fingerprint, so baselining one silently suppressed the
  other. Regenerate layer-rule baselines with `cartograph baseline`.
- `cartograph init` no longer writes an active `include:` key. An include that matches nothing
  reports "no findings" and exits 0 — a false all-clear in an Xcode project with no `Sources/`
  directory.

### Fixed

- A relative `--project` path (`--project .`) aborted the process. libIndexStore asserts on
  relative paths, so the run died with SIGABRT before the exit-code contract could apply. Project
  paths are now resolved to absolute before reaching the index layer.
- A glob with no separator now matches any path component, as gitignore does. `exclude: ["Pods"]`
  used to filter nothing under `Pods/`, and `retained_files: ["Generated"]` retained nothing at
  all — files the user asked to protect were reported as unused.
- Unknown keys inside `layers` and `rules` are now reported. A typo such as `denyed:` left the
  rule inert with no warning, so `rules` passed with no enforcement at all.
- `metrics` now fails when a configured threshold is exceeded, matching every other command. The
  same config file previously contained thresholds that gate CI and thresholds that do not.
- `metrics --report-format sarif` (and `checkstyle`, `xcode`, `github-actions`) now emits that
  format instead of the metrics JSON document, which code scanning rejected.
- `dead --explain` now applies the baseline, so `--strict` no longer reaches opposite verdicts for
  the same repository depending on the reporting flag.
- `dead --explain` on a name that matches nothing now exits 64 instead of 0, so a typo in a CI
  script is visible.
- Baseline write failures are reported as tool failures (exit 2) instead of findings (exit 1).
- Broken symlinks are no longer returned as source files, and two names for the same file are
  counted once.
- `SourceLocation.relative(to:)` handles the macOS `/tmp` ↔ `/private/tmp` duality, so report
  paths are relativized in both spellings.
- Mermaid labels escape `#` first, so a name containing an entity-like sequence is not eaten.
- Escaped identifiers (`` `default` ``) and failable initializers (`init?(rawValue:)`) now match
  their syntax declarations. Neither matched before, so a public declaration was analyzed as
  internal and reported unused.
- Declarations inside function bodies, accessors and closures are no longer recorded as syntax
  facts. A local sharing a member's name could be nearer to the index line and hijack the match,
  overwriting the member's accessibility or attaching a `cartograph:ignore` meant for the local.
- Operator declarations are recorded like every other declaration.
- DerivedData ownership matching tolerates case differences, symlinked checkouts and XML entities
  in `WorkspacePath`. Any of those made the check fall back to every same-named directory.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- Analysis results move with this release. The accessor and `main.swift` fixes add edges that were
  previously missing, so findings that were false positives disappear. Regenerate any baseline with
  `cartograph baseline`.
- `IndexStoreProvider.defaultDatabasePath(forStore:libraryPath:libraryModificationDate:)` no longer
  defaults its toolchain arguments. Callers must supply them, because a DerivedData store path is
  stable across Xcode upgrades and omitting the identity silently reopened a cache written by an
  older toolchain.

### Fixed

- Declarations referenced only from inside a computed property's getter or setter, or from a
  `willSet`/`didSet` observer, are no longer reported as unused. The index records such calls
  against the accessor, which is not a graph node, so those edges were dropped entirely. Accessor
  references now resolve to their property. This mattered most for code built around computed
  properties, such as RxSwift's `Reactive<Base>` extensions.
- Executables whose entry point is `main.swift` are no longer reported as entirely unused.
  Top-level statements have no enclosing declaration, so they produced no edges at all, and
  top-level declarations carry no `@main` marker. Each `main.swift` now gets a synthetic
  `top-level code` node that owns its statements, and its top-level declarations count as entry
  points.
- Generic type parameters are no longer graph nodes. The index records them as type aliases, so
  `Base` in `struct Reactive<Base>` was reported as unused.
- Syntax facts now match index symbols by name rather than by line alone. Two declarations on one
  line no longer swap accessibility and attributes, and a declaration whose attribute sits on the
  preceding line (`@discardableResult`, `@objc`) no longer loses its facts entirely — previously
  the name fallback never matched a function, because index names carry argument labels
  (`emit(_:options:)`) and syntax names do not.
- Conformances declared in an extension (`extension Money: Codable {}`) now reach the extended
  type, so its stored properties and enum cases are retained.
- `test`-prefixed methods in production code are no longer treated as XCTest cases. The full
  XCTest contract is checked: an instance method of a class or extension, taking no arguments and
  returning nothing.
- A trailing `// cartograph:ignore` on the same line as a declaration now applies to it. Trailing
  comments live in the declaration's trailing trivia, which was never read.
- Interface Builder documents are parsed by XML rules rather than an exact `customClass="` match,
  so `customClass = 'ThemedButton'` is found, values inside XML comments are skipped, attribute
  names no longer match as suffixes of longer names, and `.XIB` matches case-insensitively.
- A DerivedData directory belonging to a different checkout of a same-named project is no longer
  selected. Ownership is resolved from `info.plist`'s `WorkspacePath`.
- `.build/<triple>/debug/index/store` layouts are searched.
- `deinit` declarations now carry syntax facts.
- The index cache path now requires the toolchain identity from its caller, and the definition
  occurrence's location wins over a declaration-only one.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-02

First release.

### Added

- `graph` renders the dependency graph at module, file, type or symbol resolution, in Graphviz DOT,
  Mermaid, JSON or a self-contained HTML page with no external resources.
- `cycles` finds circular dependencies via Tarjan's algorithm, reports a representative shortest
  cycle per strongly connected component, and names the lowest-weight edge as the cheapest cut.
- `dead` finds declarations unreachable from retained roots, with retention rules covering entry
  points, XCTest, swift-testing, Objective-C exposure, Interface Builder, raw-value enum cases,
  `CodingKeys`, property-wrapper and result-builder requirements, `Codable` stored properties,
  external overrides and conformances, dynamic dispatch, and comment commands.
- `dead --explain` reports why a declaration survives — the retention reason, or the path from a
  retained root.
- `metrics` computes afferent and efferent coupling, instability, abstractness and distance from
  the main sequence, and classifies each node into the main sequence, the zone of pain or the zone
  of uselessness.
- `rules` enforces ArchUnit-style layering rules declared in `.cartograph.yml`, and reports nodes
  that no layer covers.
- `baseline` records current findings so only new ones fail the build. Fingerprints are USR-based
  and survive line moves.
- `init` writes a commented configuration template.
- Diagnostic output as text, JSON, Xcode, Checkstyle, GitHub Actions or SARIF.
- Index store auto-detection across SwiftPM layouts and Xcode DerivedData, preferring the most
  recently written store.
- `CartographKit` ships as a library product for embedding the pipeline directly. Its query API
  (`cycles(in:)`, `unusedCode(in:)`, `metrics(in:)`, `layerViolations(in:)`) returns values;
  baselines, thresholds and formatting live in a separate command API so an embedder never parses
  rendered text. `loadContext()` reads the index once and serves every resolution from it.

### Notes

- `retain_objc_accessible` defaults to on, unlike Periphery. Mixed-language UIKit projects were its
  largest source of false positives.
- Exit codes: `0` success, `1` findings with `--strict` or a threshold exceeded, `2` tool failure,
  `64` usage error.
- Supported toolchain: Swift 6.3 or later on macOS 14+, verified on 6.3.3 in CI and 6.4 in
  development. `indexstore-db` publishes no semantic version tags, so `Package.swift` pins the
  `release/6.4.1` branch. Each Swift release moves that pin and gets a changelog entry.
- macOS only in practice: the index store format and `libIndexStore` discovery are Apple-toolchain
  specific.
